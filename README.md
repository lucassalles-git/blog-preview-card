##Overview

I created a blog card with HTML and CSS. The goal was to practice semantic HTML, responsiveness, and to organize a card in a screen-centered manner with reduced font sizes for smaller screens without using media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexible Box
- Grid
- Media Queries
- Mobile-First Layout

###What I Learned

I learned how to:

- Slightly shrink and enlarge fonts without having to use media queries, just using ``clamp()``:
```css
h1 { 
font-size: clamp(1.2rem, 6vw, 1.5rem);
}

```
